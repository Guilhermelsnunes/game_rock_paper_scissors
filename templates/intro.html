    <h3>
        Rock is designated by maintaining the fist, Scissors by extending the middle and index fingers, and Paper by holding the hand out flat. <br> 
        If players throw out the same gesture, the game goes on. <br>
        If not, it's decided by a harmonic and intransitive method â€” rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, but paper covers rock.
