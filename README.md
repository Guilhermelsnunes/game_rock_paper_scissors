# game_rock_paper_scissors 

This game my first web-based application. 

On the Homepage you have a welcoming message and a brief description on how to play the game. You also can click on the button "Let's play" to move to the next screen and start the game. 

Once in the play page both players have the option to put their names and to select between rock/paper/scissors.

After clicking "Play Game" you are taken to a different screen where you will see the results and will show the item selected, showing why you won with a message to the winner and further explanation of the selected options.
